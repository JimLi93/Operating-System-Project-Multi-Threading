# Operating System Project: Multi-Threading

## Introduction

It is a project that implement preemptive multithreading and semaphore to sumulate real-world car parking problem.

## Compiler and Simulator

Use SDCC to compile and edsim51 simulator to simulate the car parking problem.

## Checkpoint

### Checkpoint 1

Implement a cooperative multithreading package and a test case based on the single-buffer producer-consumer example.

### Checkpoint 2

Implement preemptive multithreading package and a test case based on the single-buffer producer-consumer example.

### Checkpoint 3

Implement semaphore with busy wait for preemptive multithreading.

Test code using the classical bounded-buffer example.

### Checkpoint 4

Test code using 2-producers, 1 consumer example.

### Checkpoint 5

Add a `delay(n)` function.

Implement thread recycling to free up spaces when terminated.

Test delay and thread recycling using the parking lot example.
